# INSTRUCTIONS:

You need to develop your home page by creating an HTML file called index.html and a CSS file called style.css. You can develop these pages using VS Code on your local machine or in the UGL Project sandbox provided earlier in this lesson. The reading 
Setting up your local development environment
 provides the steps on how to set up VS Code on your computer if your choose to do so. 

If you plan on using the UGL sandbox, your work will only be available during that session. Take note that the Project Sandbox only allows you to work for one hour at a time. Make sure you download your files before exiting the UGL. To work on your project again later, you can simply open the HTML and CSS files on your local machine and copy and paste the code again into the template files in the Project Sandbox. Remember to download the edited versions again at the end of the session.

To submit your project you need to download your files to your local machine by right-clicking on them in the Explorer panel and selecting "Download".

You will be required to submit your home page by uploading a zipped project folder that contains your HTML and CSS file. To learn more about how to zip and unzip folders visit the 
Mac
 or 
Windows
 support page.

Visual layout

When viewing the home page in the browser:

Is it clear that this is a home page for one of the four fictional clients?

Is the correct company logo at the top of the page?

Is there a horizontal navigation menu with four links below the logo?

Does one of the links in the navigation menu link to the home page itself?

Does the main content contain a large promotional banner at the top and three columns below it, each containing an image and some text?

Does the page have a footer that is split into two columns?

Does the left column of the footer contain a small version of the client logo and the right column copyright text?

Semantic structure

When opening the HTML file in VS Code, does it contain:

A header element for the logo?

A nav element for the navigation menu?

A main element for the content?

A footer element for the footer?

Appropriate usage of other semantic tags such as article and section in the content of the main element?

  About the portfolio project
By completing the lessons in this course, you have acquired the necessary HTML and CSS skills and knowledge to develop a home page with a header, main content and footer. You will have to decide whether you are going to use a grid or flexbox layout for your home page. Your header should contain the client logo and the main content should be a large promotional banner with three columns with text and images below it. Your footer will have two columns: the first column should have a small logo and the second one should have copywriting information. When it comes to styling, you'll have to create the appropriate look and feel for your client's target audience. Remember, you want to create intentional engagement!

To enable you to do all of this, the module covers the most essential features of your project. This includes: selecting your fictional client, working out your layout, positioning the elements, planning the user experience, creating themes and setting up your local development environment.

What is the purpose of the portfolio project?
The graded assessment will help you to establish which topics you have mastered, and which topics require further focus before you can complete the course. Ultimately, the graded assessment is designed to help you make sure that you are ready for the next course in this program. And even more, you get the opportunity to create another project for your portfolio.

How do I prepare for the graded portfolio project?
You have encountered exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments as you have progressed through the course. Nothing in the graded assessment will be outside what you have covered already, so you should be well placed to succeed.

What will I be doing?
The purpose of this graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of this course. And what better way to do that than by applying your newly-learned skills in a practical way? You will develop a home page for one of four fictional clients. And you can read more about them in the 
Subject selection 
reading. The client you choose will determine what links, pictures and colors you will use. You are free to use your creativity but the home page needs to meet certain criteria regarding the following:

Visual layout

Semantic structure

CSS layout

CSS styling

CSS effects

========================

CSS layout, styling and effects

When viewing the home page in the browser:

Is the use of CSS styling effective?

Is CSS used to create appropriate interactivity?

When opening the CSS file in VS code, ask yourself the following:

Is it a grid or flexbox layout?

Does it have the appropriate selectors to style elements?

Does it specify any pseudo-classes to create interactivity on the home page?

Are any animations or transition effects used? Do they improve the user experience or distract from it?

Overall effect of the home page

Does the home page create adequate interaction and a pleasing visual experience that is fitting for the client and its customers? 

Are CSS styling and effects used effectively to create intentional engagement? 

What works well? 

What advice can you give to improve the user experience, layout and visuals of the home page?

You'll also need to give feedback on and grade the assignments of two other learners using the same criteria.
